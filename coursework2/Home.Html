<!-- NOTE: Here I inserted my audio, I added controls so the user can decide when it is played, stopped and the ovlume level.
I also provided two different file types, this is so whichever browser the user is using
to look at the site if for some reason the browser doesnt support mp3 files it will then have the option to use
a wav file. If both of these options do not work I added a message that will pop up apoligising for the error, and giving the user an option to
install the file. -->
